  abstract = {Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) 
  is a commonly known and used algorithm for data clustering. 
  It applies a density-based approach and can produce clusters 
  of any shape. However, it has a drawback—its worst-case computational 
  complexity is O(n²) with regard to the number of data items n. 
  The paper presents GrDBSCAN: a granular modification of DBSCAN 
  with reduced complexity. The proposed GrDBSCAN first granulates 
  data into fuzzy granules and then runs density-based clustering 
  on the resulting granules. The complexity of GrDBSCAN is linear with
  regard to the input data size and higher only for the number of granules. 
  That number is, however, a parameter of the GrDBSCAN algorithm 
  and is (significantly) lower than that of input data items. This 
  results in shorter clustering time than in the case of DBSCAN. 
  The paper is accompanied by numerical experiments. The implementation 
  of GrDBSCAN is freely available from a public repository.},

  abstract = {The three-way decision approach is an emerging paradigm in the design 
  of tools for data mining and machine learning. It switches from a two-way 
  classification (“negative” and “positive” class) to three decisions: 
  “negative”, “positive”, and non-commitment class. It means that when for 
  some data it is not possible to elaborate a reliable answer they are assigned 
  with a non-commitment class. In the paper we apply this paradigm for a cascade 
  of neuro-fuzzy classifiers. If the first neuro-fuzzy system assigns a data 
  item with a non-commitment class, the next neuro-fuzzy system is run for 
  this data item. For easy items the first system is enough, but for harder 
  ones two or more systems have to be run. Neuro-fuzzy systems elaborate 
  interpretable fuzzy models. The models are composed of fuzzy rules that can 
  be interpreted linguistically by humans. Application of neuro-fuzzy systems 
  results in a cascade of interpretable models. The paper describes algorithms 
  for training a cascade of neuro-fuzzy classifiers and for elaboration 
  of answers. The paper presents results of numerical experiments that show 
  that this technique can elaborate results with lower generalisation error

  The algorithm also assigns weights to attributes in each cluster; this leads

  iterative procedure based on minimising of criterion function. The crucial 
  parameter of the proposed algorithm is the parameter having the influence on 
  the sharpness of elaborated subspace cluster. The lower values of the 
  parameter lead to selection of the most important attribute. The higher values

each fuzzy rule has its own attributes' weights, thus it exists in its own weighted subspace.
